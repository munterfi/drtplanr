Description: Tool for placing virtual stations in demand-responsive transport systems in villages by defining and minimizing a global energy (\code{drtplanr}, name is inspired by \code{stplanr} <https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr>). The station locations are randomly initialized in the street network and iteratively optimized based on the reachable population in combination with walking and driving times.
